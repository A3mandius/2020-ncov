## Summary

• To estimate the early dynamics of transmission and control in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission model to multiple datasets: temporal data on date of onset of international exported cases from Wuhan; date of onset and confirmed cases in Wuhan. Export rate to different countries was weighted based on the [risk ranking by MOBS lab](https://www.mobs-lab.org/2019ncov.html) - WorldPop have a similar risk ranking (see [Table 5 here](https://www.worldpop.org/events/china)). We considered the 30 countries most at risk in the analysis. The model accounts for delays in symptom onset and reported (see methods below).

• We estimated the reproduction had been fluctuating between 1.5-4 prior to travel restrictions being introduced on 23rd Jan, and found strong evidence R>2 in early January. We found some evidence of a decline in the reproduction number after a peak in early January.

• Our model suggests that exported cases linked to Wuhan will continue to be observed in the coming days, but gradually decline. We have growing uncertainty in our estimates after 23rd Jan because the signal from international cases gets weaker after travel restrictions were introduced.

## Caveats and ongoing work

• We used biological parameters from current papers, but these may change as we get better data. We also made assumptions about the proportion of people who travel following the methods in the [J-IDEA reports](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/). However, jointly fitting to multiple datasets will reduce the influence that one single dataset has on results.

• We are currently using [risk ranking by MOBS lab](https://www.mobs-lab.org/2019ncov.html) for exported cases, but are also exploring other datasets

• The model is flexible, so we can (and will) incorporate new information and data as it comes available.


## Methods

#### Model

We used a stochastic SEIR model implemented using the Euler-Maruyama algorithm with a 6hr timestep, with transmission rate following geometric brownian motion (i.e. dlog(beta) = s dBt, where s is the volatility of transmission over time). We assume no travel out of Wuhan occurs after 23rd Jan, when restrictions were put in place.

The population is divided into susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed, with a fraction of exposed individuals subsequently travelling and eventually being detected in their destination country_", out.width = '40%'}

```

#### Fitting

We estimated the time varying reproduction using sequential Monte Carlo by jointly fitting to three datasets (see table below for references):

We used a Poisson observation model with different relative reporting probability for cases inside and outside of Wuhan, and only a fraction of cases having known onset dates. Plots were generated by running 200 repetitions of SMC with 2000 particles. The volatility and reporting parameters were selected based on a grid search to find the maximum likelihood. We assumed the outbreak started on 15th November with 10 infectious individuals and 10 in their incubation period. We also assume all infectious people become symptomatic and would be eventually be detected in destination country if they travelled by plane. We assumed that the population at risk was 10m (rather than 19m assumed in Imperial analysis) because most cases to date are adults and this group are more likely to travel.
