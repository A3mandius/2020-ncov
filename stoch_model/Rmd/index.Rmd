## Summary of results

To estimate the dynamics of transmission in Wuhan before travel restrictions were imposed on 23rd Jan, we fitted a stochastic transmission model to three datasets: temporal data on onset date of international exported cases from Wuhan; onset date of confirmed cases in Wuhan; onset date of early confirmed cases in China. Export rate to different countries was weighted based on the [risk ranking by MOBS lab](https://www.mobs-lab.org/2019ncov.html) - WorldPop have a similar risk ranking (see [Table 5 here](https://www.worldpop.org/events/china)). We considered the 30 countries most at risk in the analysis. The model accounts for delays in symptom onset and reported (see methods below).

We estimated the reproduction had been growing prior to travel restrictions being imposed, and found strong evidence R>1 in early January. Our model suggests that exported cases from Wuhan will continue to be observed in the coming days, but decline.

## Methods

#### Model

We used a stochastic SEIR model implemented using the Euler-Maruyama algorithm with a 6hr timestep, with transmission rate following geometric brownian motion (i.e. dlog(beta) = s dBt, where s is the volatility of transmission over time). We assume no travel out of Wuhan occurs after 23rd Jan, when restrictions were put in place.

The population is divided into susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed, with a fraction of exposed individuals subsequently travelling and eventually being detected in their destination country", out.width = '60%'}

```

#### Fitting

We estimated the time varying reproduction using sequential Monte Carlo by fitting to daily incidence of exported cases (or lack thereof) over time in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (i.e. top 30 most at risk), as well as domestic cases. We used  a Poisson observation model. Plots were generated by running 200 repetitions of SMC with 2000 particles. The volatility and reporting scaling parameter was selected based on a grid search to find the maximum likelihood. We assumed the outbreak started on 15th November with 10 infectious individuals and 10 in their incubation period. We also assume all infectious people become symptomatic and would be eventually be detected in destination country if they travelled by plane. We assumed that the population at risk was 10m (rather than 19m assumed in Imperial analysis) because most cases to date are adults and this group are more likely to travel.
